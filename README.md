### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Braden, a junior at Yale University studying Ethics, Politics, and Economics with Computer Science.

I'm interested in doing the most good that I can with my life, and so far, it seems like tech and policy are the most impactful ways to improve the world. I love building things, and currently, software engineering seems to be the best way to scratch that itch, so you could call me a hobbyist coder.

I've been on a resolution to make one commit a day for the past few years. Many of these commmits are a combination between my various personal projects and an Obsidian vault where I take all my notes.
