Hey everyone, I'm Braden! üëã

I'm building [Epicenter](https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/epicenter) (YC S25). I started as a humanities student at Yale studying `Ethics, Politics, and Economics`, but fell in love with `coding` in my first year. Since then, my mission has been to bridge the gaps between the two disciplines, building and writing in public as avenues to do good. üßë‚Äçüíª

At Epicenter, I build open-source tooling that maximizes data ownership and transparency. Our vision is to build an open-source, local-first ecosystem for storing your entire digital life in a single folder of plaintext and SQLite. It‚Äôs yours to own, tweak, and share. On top of that, we'll build an ecosystem of local-first apps that use your folder as shared memory.

While I've been fortunate to have wonderful industry jobs in the past, open-source software has a special place in my heart. It is liberating to code without worrying about profits and temptations to monetize users or profit from their data. While I make much less in open-source software, I am fortunate to make it my full-time career.

Your support through [sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/braden-w) is greatly appreciated, but please only contribute if you feel financially secure enough to do so. Your contributions enable me to pursue and develop projects like [Epicenter](https://github.com/epicenter-so/epicenter), [Wellcrafted](https://github.com/wellcrafted-dev/wellcrafted), and other projects that I hope to help the community. Thank you for your time!
