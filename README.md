Hey everyone, I'm Braden! üëã

I'm a full-time student at Yale who started off as a humanities kid, but fell in love with coding in my first year, and now study `Ethics, Politics, and Economics` with `Computer Science`. üë®‚Äçüíª

I seek to bridge the gaps between the two disciplines and focus on open-source tooling for creators that maximizes data ownership and transparency.

I'm interested in doing the most good that I can with my life, and it seems tech and policy are the most impactful ways to do this. I love building things, and software engineering seems to be the best way to scratch that itch (for now).

I've been on a resolution to make one commit a day for the past few years. Many of these commits are a combination between my various personal projects and a vault where I take all my notes!

While I've been fortunate to have wonderful industry jobs, open-source software has a special place in my heart. It is liberating to code without worrying about profits and temptations to monetize users or profit from their data. While I make much less in open-source software, I aspire to make this my full-time career.

Your support through [sponsorships](https://github.com/sponsors/braden-w) is greatly appreciated, but please only contribute if you feel financially secure enough to do so. Your contributions enable me to pursue and develop projects like [Whispering](https://github.com/braden-w/whispering) and other projects that I hope to help the community. Thank you for your time!
