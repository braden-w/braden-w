### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Braden, a junior at Yale University studying Ethics, Politics, and Economics with Computer Science.

I'm interested in doing the most good that I can with my life, and it seems tech and policy are the most impactful ways to do this. I love building things, and software engineering seems to be the best way to scratch that itch (for now).

I've been on a resolution to make one commit a day for the past few years. Many of these commits are a combination between my various personal projects and an Obsidian vault where I take all my notes.
